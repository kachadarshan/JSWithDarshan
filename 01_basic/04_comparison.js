//here we have to do comparison ==,<=,>= like

// console.log(1<2);
// console.log(2==2);
// console.log(1<2);
// console.log(2 !=1);
// console.log(2>=1);


//when two differrent data types are in comparison that time data type are converted 
// mdn not allow to compare two different data types 

//console.log("2" > 1); //here string and int are in comparison so here 1 value is converted in string so output is 21


// But Solution of this problem is used (===) this comparison called Strically comparison

console.log("2" === 1);
